# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. From the repository root, enter the mobile app folder and install dependencies

   ```bash
   cd mobile-app
   npm ci
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **src/app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

### Android maps

Expo Go includes a map key for testing. For a development or release build, enable Maps SDK for Android in Google Cloud and provide `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` as an environment variable when building. Restrict the key to the app's Android package name and signing certificate SHA-1, and rebuild the app. The key is embedded in the app binary, so it is not a secret; restrictions are required. See the [Expo map setup](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/v58.0.0/sdk/map-view/#deploy-app-with-google-maps).

On Android, the report form is temporarily stored in the app's private cache while the camera or gallery is open, so it can be recovered if Android restarts the app. The cache is removed after recovery or when the picker returns; the operating system can clear cache under storage pressure. The report is not sent or saved as an official report.

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **example** directory and create a blank **src/app** directory where you can start developing.
